      "raw": "\n## What is ADHD? \n\nWhenever the topic of mental health comes up, I always find that it's important to cover the basics. ADHD is an initialism for **Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder**. \n\nIn short, it causes the brain to function differently. Research has shown that those with ADHD often have brains that are structured differently and that we can have imbalanced neurotransmitter levels. \n\n## What is it like to have ADHD? \n\n**This is my own personal experience, ADHD tends to vary a lot by individual.**\n\nI'm on medication now and have a number of coping mechanisms (more on those later) that I've developed over the years to handle my ADHD, but these are the top three ways that the condition has historically manifested for me within the workplace: \n\n### Task Motivation\n\nI've found the easiest way to communicate ADHD to somebody that doesn't have it, is to get them to think of a time that they've been trying to get away from something in a nightmare. \n\nYou know what you need to do, the motivation and stress/panic is there. But what you see, think and want doesn't translate to action. \n\nThen ask them to imagine that they're not trying to get away from a monster, or out of a burning building. But that they just need to do the washing up. \n\nThat analogy often gets a laugh, but it's absolutely true. We're not talking about the standard 'Oh I just don't want to do it' lack of motivation that's often a factor in household chores. We're talking about sitting at a desk, being unable to do anything for 10 minutes because you know you need to do the washing up, but when you think of the washing up you also remember that you said you would clean the shower last month, and that you need to clean your car after you drove on salted roads, and, and, and... \n\nYou get the idea... Hopefully. \n\n### Time Blindness \n\nI'm pretty sure at this point that if I got to the afterlife and there was a dashboard showing statistics about your life, that 'sorry I'm late' would be my top spoken sentence. \n\nIt's not intentional, I promise. If I say I'll be there in 5 minutes, I mean it in the moment. If I set a meeting for 3PM, I want to be there at 3. But as a prime example of how this happens I sat down at 10:30 today to complete a task for a job application before I walked the dog. \n\nSince 10:30, I've sent another job application, gone on a Support jobs board, saw a post asking about managing ADHD which gave me the idea for this article, fixed formatting on this website, written a resume section and implemented a contact method. \n\nI still haven't walked the dog, it's now 15:50 - sorry Jerry. \n\nI'm actually going to stop writing this now and walk him. This is actually one of my methods of managing ADHD. Writing what I need to do to force my brain to go 'you need to do that, right now'. \n\nIt's something that feels silly to do, let alone write. But it works. \n\n### Hyperfocus\n\nRemember that time that you sat down and crunched out that thing you needed to do in one long sprint when it should have taken you days? \n\nNow imagine that your brains two modes of focus are that, and none. \n\nWelcome to ADHD. \n\nThe medication that I take (Methylphenidate Hydrochloride for the curious) helps to even this out so I can more casually focus on things, but it's something that I still have to conciously manage. The brain mode can also vary by the day, or by the hour. \n\nWhen unmedicated there were ways I could mitigate the impact, but trying to focus when my brain wasn't in a focusing mood felt like I was constantly spinning my wheels. It led to immense frustration, both on my part and for those around me.\n\n\n## Managing ADHD\n\nFor those that have ADHD, especially in the modern world of constantly changing priorities and easily accessible distractions, coping mechanisms are essential. They help you to make the most of your work and personal lives. \n\nI've been lucky enough to work in places that have an open-minded approach to neurodiversity, which have helped me refine these mechanisms over the years. I owe particular thanks to [Tara Ryan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tara-ryan-88500764/) the VP of People Experience at Monzo Bank. She befriended me early in my career at Monzo, and gave me a position on a Mental Health First Aid training course that not only helped me improve my own management style, but started my journey towards ADHD diagnosis. \n\nThis is a list of the coping mechanisms that I have found most effective, your mileage may vary. \n\n### Communication, Communication, Communication \n\nCommunication is always tricky, because it varies so much based on what you're doing, who you're speaking to and even where you are. But open and empathetic communication is essential to cope with ADHD. Those around you can't understand or help you with what they don't know. \n\nAs somebody who has historically been quite introverted when it comes to personal matters this is something that I'm still struggling with, but when I have spoken openly about my ADHD, it has always led to improvements in my personal and work life. \n\n\n### Setting a Schedule \n\nI've always found comfort in the known. It's part of what makes me good at building out processes. To deal with Task Motivation I like to have certain parts of my life on a fixed schedule. As an example, when I wake up in the morning the first thing I do is have breakfast and a coffee. \n\nIt sounds basic, but for somebody with ADHD these small fixtures in the day really help me keep on track. \n\n### Audio Prompts \n\nLate last year I got into building things using Raspberry pi's, as a part of my developer journey. I built [this clock](https://thepihut.com/products/electronic-clock-for-raspberry-pi-pico) which I use to play around with coding concepts. \n\nWhen it's not being used for that, it sits at my work desk. You can make it beep on the hour, every hour. Since putting it together, I've found that this audible reminder (that isn't connected to a phone, which can lead to further distractions) extremely useful. \n\nI use it as a prompt to take a deep breath, take myself out of whatever I'm working on and think about what I'm doing as well as what I need to get done during the day. \n\nThe beep doesn't require dismissing, so if I'm concentrating on something particularly difficult, or I'm focusing on something that I need to get done I can easily ignore it. But it serves as a useful nudge to take a step back when I've become unfocused. \n\n### Exercise \n\nI try to go to the gym 3 times a week. Monday, Wednesday and Friday (there's that schedule again). On the days I'm not at the gym, I take the dog for a walk before sitting down to work. As somebody that has spent most of his career working remotely, this not only gets me out of the house and socialising but also serves as a welcome 'circuit breaker' in what would otherwise by a full day inside. \n\nMaking sure my mind doesn't go into work mode the second I'm out of bed makes sure that I save that 'brain processing power' for when I start the work day. \n\n\n## Managing somebody with ADHD\n\nMental health awareness only seems to be improving (thank god), so there isn't as much stigma around conditions like ADHD as there used to be. But there are a number of people (myself included) that dealt with significant adversity as a result of ADHD behaviours while growing up (and in later life). These experiences can lead to those with ADHD to try and maintain a 'stiff upper lip' attitude. \n\nIt's important for you as a manager to make sure you clearly communicate your understanding and desire to work with your reports on issues that may be caused by ADHD. \n\nSo with that in mind, just like with personal management of ADHD we start with: \n\n### Communication, Communication, Communication\n\nEvery leader has heard the warning that being too friendly with their reports will cause trouble. Not only is this not a universal truth - I mean just think about how motivated you are to do something for a friend vs a boss who barks orders - but the message often taken away from the warning is 'don't let your reports talk about their personal lives'. \n\nIf you don't talk to your reports about their personal lives, you will find yourself being the last one told about anything that effects them, which means that you can't be effective as their manager because you will be acting only on what you can observe. What we observe is never the full picture.\n\nThere is a balance to be struck of course. But open, empathetic conversations with anybody you manage is essential, especially if they have ADHD (or show symptoms). \n\nBy creating an open empathetic atmosphere you can turn your 'Hey, how is that project going' message or meeting from something the person with ADHD fears (because they haven't found the focus needed progress as much as they think you want), to something they welcome (because they know you're giving them a nudge to help them keep on track).\n\n### Flexibility \n\nIf you're managing somebody with ADHD, you'll find flexibility is key to getting the best out of them. You should consider: \n\n- Flexible schedules (if your workplace supports them, if they don't - start having that conversation)\n\nPeople with ADHD, as I touched on when I spoke about Hyperfocus, struggle to 'opt in' to focusing on a task. By not holding them to rigid working times you can give them the autonomy to work when they are at their most productive. This doesn't just apply to working hours though. It also applies to role responsibilities, have a conversation with your ADHD report about what their ideal day structure would look like. They may for example find it easier to do tasks in a certain order, by taking this onboard you can maximise their productivity and happiness at the same time. It's a win win.  \n\n- Flexible responsibilities. \n\nOn the note of responsibilities... For me, what attracts me to roles that focus on creating productive internal cultures and delivering fantastic customer experiences is the fact that every customer is different, so you have to be constantly flexible in your approach. If you have somebody with ADHD, you typically won't get the best out of them if you keep them focused on a single, repetitive task over a long period of time. \n\n- Flexible Approach \n\nAll good managers have a 'component toolkit' of strategies that they use to delegate tasks and deliver updates. Most people will be familiar the scenario of sitting in a meeting, paying avid attention to what somebody is saying and nodding along then completely blanking on it when asked a question about what was just covered 5 minutes later.\n\nThis happens far more regularly for those with ADHD. If you have somebody with ADHD, make sure that you're not rushing through an update and encourage them to write things down as you cover topics. \n\nIf you're presenting a slideshow, avoid making the written content overly verbose. The ADHD mind often works on a principle of 'copy now, understand later', so making sure that your written as well as verbal language priortises accessibility will help you get the best out of your team member. \n\n- Flexible Check-ins \n\nWhen being managed as somebody with ADHD, one of the most common frustrations was the mandatory manager check in. We all know the type, the meeting that's at a fixed time every single week and that happens regardless of whether there is anything to actually discuss. Both manager and managee turn up, have a chat and ultimately conclude that there isn't anything more to discuss before going back to work before the end of the time slot. \n\nThe manager without ADHD goes straight back to work. The ADHD team member spent at least the hour before being less productive, trying to think of conversational topics and spends the hour after trying to refocus back in on what they're meant to be doing. \n\nI've found both as manager and managee, that unless mandatory check ins are required (performance management) or requested, that it's better to make these opt in. If you don't have anything that you need to discuss with the team member, check in with them at the beginning of the day and ask whether they have anything they want to cover in your check in, or whether they want to use the time to have a more general catch up. If they don't, then don't be afraid to cancel the check in! \n\n\n### Patience and understanding\n\nThe 'copy now, understand later' thought process can often lead to those with ADHD needing to ask for clarification after you've covered an agenda item. When your mind is trying to think of 5 things at once, it's easy to fall into the trap of not actually thinking about what is right in front of you. \n\nAs a manager, often trying to fit an update into a specific time frame this can cause frustration. But as managers, we need to manage by putting our teams first. \n\nIf you have somebody with ADHD on your team, make sure to schedule enough time to allow them to ask questions after each point or section. By planning the stops in ahead of time you'll avoid feelings of frustration that the team member will pick up on. \n\nIf you don't, the team member is likely to notice this frustration developing, causing them to feel intimidated and unwelcome.\n\n\n### Measureable Milestones \n\nIf you want to get the best out of a team member with ADHD making sure they know what they're working towards, how long they have to do it and what success looks like is essential. \n\nI mentioned struggles with prioritisation. The more information that somebody with ADHD has to \n\n\n\n\n### Proactive Reward and Recognition \n\nAs a manager, hopefully this is something you're already doing. But it deserves a point here in the ADHD team member management advice regardless. \n\nIf the team members ADHD working habits are benefitting the business and your teams output, make sure to recognise them for it. Ask yourself questions such as:\n\n- Is it a specific instance of them going above and beyond? \n\nIf so, a tangible and personal display of appreciation can go a long way. \n\nTo this day when people ask me about the time I most felt recognised I tell them about [Calum Clark](https://www.linkedin.com/in/calum-clark-499203142/). One of my first managers at Monzo. \n\nAfter somebody called in sick I stayed up with another colleague until the early hours of the morning (we were both on 3PM - Midnight shifts originally) responding to customers. I was in a hyperfocus state so had plenty of energy, but we both did it without being asked and expecting no extra recognition. For us, it was part of the job of delivering the amazing customer support that Monzo is known for. \n\nThe next week, a box arrived at the door including a thank you card, chocolates and one of the recently released Star Trek magnetic deltas. In a single move Calum had shown me that he not only appreciated what I had done, but also that he listened to and cared about my interests. \n\n- Is it a broader pattern of behaviour? \n\nThe lack of individual task focus caused by ADHD can often lead to ADHD team members taking on tasks and solving problems that don't sit within their typical role responsibilities. \n\nIf this is the case for a member of your team, take it is an opportunity to create or recommend progression and skill development options for them.\n\nAs a manager that has coached multiple team members to become high performing managers and domain specialists I can testify to the long term returns of this strategy for businesses!\n\n## Onboarding Checklist \n\nI'm concious that this post has covered a great deal of information. If you're onboarding a new team member with ADHD you may have read this far and feel a bit overwhelmed. Over the years I've developed an 'onboarding checklist' for new team members, developed through my experiences. I hope that you find it useful: \n\n- [ ] Implement any adjustments that they've asked for in the hiring process.  \n- [ ] Have a 1:1 welcome meeting on their first day.\n- [ ] Check if they're comfortable sharing their ADHD with the wider team. Some aren't comfortable sharing this information! \n- [ ] Schedule in an opportunity for them to meet the team, base this around a social activity rather than 'tell me something about yourself' type questions. \n- [ ] Give team members an opportunity to speak to the new team member 1:1. Training/shadowing sessions are great team interaction opportunities, but you should also try to create time for them to have social conversations without you in the room/meeting.\n- [ ] Have a mid-week catch up to check in with them on how they're settling in.\n- [ ] Run your weekly team meetings as usual and invite them to them, but make it clear that they're under no pressure to get involved with any Q&A.\n- [ ] Have an end of week catch up, covering topics such as their ideal meeting/check in frequency.\n\nThis should make sure they settle in during the first week, after this you'll need to use your own judgement and the input of your new team member(s) to shape your approach going forward.\n\n\n## Wrapping Up \n\nFor most managers, the recommendations given in the Managing somebody with ADHD section are hopefully things that you're already doing. As general recommendations I've found this approach maximises team productivity and happiness. \n\nWithout meaning to sound rude, they're just even more important if you have somebody with ADHD (or who is otherwise neurodiverse) on your team. Not being neurotypical is _tough_ in the modern working world. While mental health awareness is broadly improving, you must also consider the counter movements to this awareness. Major media outlets such as [The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/wellbeing/mental-health/how-britain-created-generation-anxious/) in the UK pump out articles punching down on those daring to consider their mental health just as important as their physical health. Bandying about harmful terms such as 'generation anxious' and 'generation sicknote' when referring to an entire demographic group of people.\n\nThose who are neurodiverse are impacted and intimidated by these movements, which means that as a manager there is an even greater pressure on you to demonstrate your openness and empathy when welcoming a new team member onboard. \n\nOnly by doing this, will you make sure that your team is reaching their maximum potential.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "raw": "\nBeing a part of a tech start up is an exciting rollercoaster of a journey. While they often come with higher salaries and better perks than more established brands, they also come with their own risks.\n\nThat, in short, is how I have found myself at the receiving end of a redundancy process for the second job in a row. \n\n## My journey\n\nI've always been what I would describe as a tech enthusiast and for that, I blame Star Trek. Hours upon hours of my formative years were spent in front of a TV screen watching the valiant crews of the Enterprise('s'), Voyager and Deep Space Nine solve their problems with technobabble and tapping panels.\n\nWho wouldn't want that as a career right? Unfortunately for me, I wasn't diagnosed with ADHD until I was 29. So trying to sit down and learn how to code, or pay attention as a teenager was a definite mountain. \n\nFortunately for me, I was diagnosed and now I have medication which helps me sit down and pay attention to what I'm reading, rather than get distracted by the latest shiny thing.

      "raw": "\nAs a keen Star Trek fan, I've always been a big fan of the LCARS (Library Computer Access & Retrieval System) aesthetic designed by Michael Okuda. It's eye catching, functional and predicted the design trend of rounded buttons long before modern web design made them popular. \n\nBack in 2020, when the covid pandemic hit the popular MMO Star Trek Online released a number of environment images [rendered from game assets](https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/11424763-send-your-video-calls-to-the-final-frontier). Remote working was being increasingly used by companies to keep operating through lockdowns and with it, Zoom and other video call platforms to enable communication. Most of these platforms allowed custom backgrounds and those of us that weren't on furlough were always seeking new ways to improve morale. \n\nI wanted to take this one step further though, and have a physical Trek inspired background for my office. \n\n## Wants and Needs\n\nThere are thousands of articles out there detailing how to build and design professional office backgrounds. \n\nWhile most, if not all video call platforms now offer a feature that blurs the background. These often cause odd visual artifacts around the individual, which can be distracting for viewers and listeners. \n\nSo when I started this project, I created my list of wants and needs: \n\n### Needs: \n\n- Ability to hide 'Trek' content: Not just for professionalism but also to cover me and companies I work for when releasing video recordings featuring me. I wouldn't want them to get a Paramount DMCA take down request! \n\n- Voyager themed: I am a Voyager fan after all. \n\n- Customisability: I didn't want a generic backlit image. I wanted something that I could customise and also build functionality into. \n\n### Wants: \n\n- Screen Accuracy: I've always been detail orientated on projects I undertake, and this is dialed up to the next level when it's replicating an existing aesthetic or object. \n\n- Reasonably Priced: When going down the replica rabbit hole, there is always the option to buy or commission a custom item from an experienced builder. While some items require this if you want them, I wanted this to be something I put together myself. \n\n## Research \n\nWith my wants and needs established, it then came time to research how they built these panels back in the 90s. I wanted that screen accuracy after all! This involved speaking with a few members of the production team, diving into my personal Star Trek reference library and making use of online resources such as Ex Astris Scientia and images of props that have been sold at auction over the years. \n\n#How the original MSDs were built: \n\nFor the Trek sets, the LCARS panels including the MSDs were backlit transparencies mounted onto smoked acrylic, then lit from behind with CFL bulbs (this was pre-LED after all). This often resulted in significant colour differences between the unlit and lit panel due to the intensity or light temperature of the bulbs used. \n\nSo far, so good. Custom acrylic sheets are relatively cheap. But what was the right tint for them? Acrylic comes in a wide spectrum of tints and smoked seemed to refer to anything from almost opaque, to almost clear. \n\nI struck gold in the form of an image from an old auction listing: \n\n<img src=\"/posts/officelcarsauctionpanel.png\"></img>\n\nAs you can see, some of the mounted transparency has peeled from the bottom right corner. Giving a clear look at the level of tint required. \n\nThen it was just a case of finding a company offering a similar tint, and placing an order!\n\nOf course I needed the actual transparency as well. This also took a fair bit of internet digging to find a company that would print the artwork I had acquired (kindly provided by another Trek artist who I won't mention in case Paramount reads this) in the size I needed, as it was a bit of an odd one to fit my intended display wall. \n\nIt also took some trial and error once I actually had this company onboard as well. Despite my initial order being clear they initially printed it with a matte finish, then they printed it on gloss but didn't wrap the artwork in protective paper properly before stuffing it in a tube so it got scratched. But third times the charm, and I also now have a bunch of spares...\n\n## Building\n\nAfter doing my research and placing the orders, it was time to start putting my custom build together. \n\nFirst on the agenda was the backlighting itself:\n\nFortunately I had some [nanoleaf shapes](https://nanoleaf.me/en-GB/products/nanoleaf-shapes/triangle-starter-kit-15-panels/) in the cupboard from my previous office going spare:\n\nMy previous wall art: \n<img src=\"/posts/officenano.jpg\"></img>\n\nSo could just use those! Another tickbox in the price conciousness column! \n\nThen I needed a frame. Anybody who has ever walked into a framing store knows that getting something made in a custom size costs far more than you would imagine if you typically buy off the shelf. \n\nThrough my internet searching, I found [Brampton Picture Framing](https://www.bramptonframing.com/). They offered a wide range, were extremely well priced and also offer mounting and hanging components, if needed. While they do deliver, given the size of the frame this was a significant cost. Again, fortunately, I was travelling south to see family when I was putting this together. So was able to just put the frame (with some difficulty) in the back of the car on the way back! \n\nOnce home, it was time to put it all together:\n\nMy sketch plan: \n\n<img src=\"/posts/officelcarsplan.jpg\"></img>\n\nMapping out the Nanoleaf shapes to best fit: \n\n<img src=\"/posts/officelcarslights.jpg\"></img>\n\n## The end result: \n\n'Off mode' for professional calls:\n\n<img src=\"/posts/officelcarsoff.jpg\"></img>\n\nShowing off customisable lights: \n\n<video src=\"/posts/officelcarsrgbvid.mp4\" autoPlay loop muted playsInline controls width=\"100%\"></video>\n\nTriumphant selfie: \n\n<img src=\"/posts/officelcarscomplete.jpg\"></img>\n\nIt took a good few months of research, buying and planning to bring it all together. But I'm very happy with the final result. I just need some better tape to disguise the nanoleaf wire now... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "raw": "\nI've always wanted to get into coding. I remember having one of the more 'custom' myspace pages back in the day because I loved playing around with the styling. In fact I remember rejecting Facebook for a good amount of time because I felt it took too much away from the user in favour of a uniform experience. \n\nBut, between ADHD and general life I never found the time or motivation. Until last year. \n\n## Finding my way back to development\n\nLast year CodeSandbox paid for me to go onto a web development essentials course with the now sadly closed down CodeClan. The course had it's pros and cons, but it did what it advertised. It taught me the essentials, and lit that 'fire' in me again. \n\nFollowing on from the course, I began getting more involved with the developer side. Making more and more PRs and Commits for the website and made product. Taking it on myself as Support lead to locate the sources of problems and fix them. As opposed to the minor tweaks I had been doing previously. \n\nI did this on top of my other responsibilities. Anybody who has worked in a start up will be familiar with the responsibility creep that occurs the longer you stay with the company. I actually put a list of job titles together that would have covered everything I did while talking with a colleague yesterday. There were 12 off the top of my head. I was doing everything from writing and recording voiceovers for marketing content, to designing, writing and implementing policies so we could pass cybersecurity certifications.\n\nOne of those titles was Project Manager. I had managed the development of our backend tooling, moving to a new billing platform and most relevant to this post and topic - transitioning to a new CRM provider. The good folks over at [Plain](https://www.plain.com/).\n\nPlain is aimed at product focused companies, like CodeSandbox. A part of this is that they have a well documented API and contact form templates. \n\nI wanted to implement one of these contact forms to streamline and improve support. One thing led to another, as they do at start ups and I ended up migrating the main website from the Next.JS pages to app router. \n\nJust another skill in the cap of a Support Lead. \n\nOne of the things that continually gave me a headache when doing the migration were the [slug] routes for the changelog. My troubles with them helped me learn a great deal about Next.JS routing and how the framework deals with markdown files. \n\nAs I was finishing up the migration, I was speaking with one of the developers who gave me nudges when I got stuck and generally acted as a sounding board when I got frustrated with the project - [Christian Jørgensen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christian-j%C3%B8rgensen-a127a856/). As he was listening to me talk about how I wanted to do more development he recommended I create a portfolio website, something I had seen was being asked for at a number of companies for developer role applications. \n\nThis is that site. \n\n## The build process\n\nI've never been amazing at 'building things from scratch', especially in areas where I'm still very much a learner. My learning process tends to involve taking things apart and putting them back together again. That or trying to change how something works and then hacking away at it until I figure out what I'm doing wrong.\n\nFortuantely for me, Next.JS provides a number of templates. I knew when starting out that I didn't want to do anything too complex. This is a portfolio after all. It should highlight content, not drown them in an over designed components. \n\nSo I launched my Next.JS app starter on CodeSandbox and set about changing the homepage to start with. If you compare it with that starter. you won't notice a huge amount of differences, but this did require I learn some typescript and tailwind. \n\nThen it was time actually make a way to show the content. Despite the frustrations, I had enjoyed working with Next.JS and markdown when migrating the CodeSandbox site. Most of my difficulty with it was making the pages routing methods work on the app router. \n\nSo I looked at a few markdown templates, and stole elements from a bunch of them. Most blog templates just opened on the content, but I didn't want that. I wanted people to be able to filter and pick what they wanted to explore from the homepage before seeing the posts themselves. This led me to using contentlayer to generate the content, and introduced me to useful packages like date-fns and reading-time. These in my opinion not only make the site look more professional, but will also make it more scaleable as I iterate on it. \n\nThe end result is now around you, but this isn't the only site I've been working on. I'm also working on a website for a writing project that I'm currently doing: \n\nHome Page: \n\n<img src=\"/posts/sitebuildpphome.png\"></img>\n\nChapter Page:\n\n<img src=\"/posts/sitebuildppchap.png\"></img>\n\nIf you've read my [office msd post](officemsd) you'll know I'm a big fan of the LCARs aesthetic (the font choice for this site - Antonio is the closest Google font to the one used for those interfaces) and given the topic of the writing project, it was an appropriate choice. \n\nBut this has taught me even more about Next.js, Typescript and Tailwind. \n\n## Future Plans \n\nObviously, I want to do more with this site in the future! One of the next projects I'm planning is moving the hosting away from Vercel and onto my Raspberry pi 5, using [Coolify](https://coolify.io/). A project that's being developed by another of my ex-CodeSandbox colleagues. \n\nStay tuned for that and other projects in the future. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

There was hope that some may turn up in bargain stores from the liquidation sale (and to be fair, some did!) but for the most part it was eBay at inflated prices, or out of luck.\n\nEnter [Master Replicas](https://www.masterreplicas.com/) who took on the gargantuan task of locating all the stock, paying off debts and shipping tiny models from around the world to and then from the UK (where they're based). \n\nThe Caretaker's Array in Star Trek merchandise was (is?) somewhat of a cursed item. There have been multiple attempts to get one of shelves from various companies but aside from a limited production run from Micro Machines (which ended up looking more like Atlantis, from Stargate: Atlantis) none have made it. \n\nFortunately, Master Replicas' got the produced Hero Collector stock out to fans, so a decent Array is finally out in the world. \n\n[Read the review on the Trek Central website](https://trekcentral.net/master-replicas-caretakers-array-review/)\n\n",

      "raw": "\nI've always felt that the 'final' (tbd at this point) Next Generation (TNG) cast film got an unfairly bad rap. Given my defence of Discovery maybe there is an element of truth in that I just like to defend things that others attack. \n\nTo explain my defence, Nemesis certainly isn't a _great_ Star Trek Movie. It was also, objectively, a terrible send off for one of Star Trek's most iconic ensembles. Between Patrick Stewart wanting a Dune buggy scene because he liked them, Brent Spiner wanting to kill off Data because he felt he was becoming 'too old' to play an ageless android (despite a line in TNG stating that he could age) and the director being the result of a 'you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours' deal and not caring about Star Trek or the cast in the slightest - to the point of constantly calling the great Levar Burton 'Laverne' it didn't really stand a chance. \n\nBut none the less, it has amazing CG effects that hold up even today. The battle (despite being slightly Wrath of Khan derivative) was incredible. Tom Hardy delivers a great performance without much to work with...\n\nThere's a lot to like, but the franchise has been trying to repair the damage this film did to TNG fans ever since. Most notably Star Trek: Picard. \n\nThis article covers a number of those connections. With a focus on the third season (that was airing at the time).\n\n[Read the article on the Trek Central website](https://trekcentral.net/star-trek-picards-nemesis-connections/)\n",
