Another of my own purchases to review here. I've wanted LEGO to take on the Star Trek license for decades, but Paramount always seems to have other plans. 

Fortunately in this case, another 'building blocks' brand took it on and has gone deeper into the franchise than I think Lego would have dared, it's nice that there are a mix of pluses and minuses verses Lego quality as well. I certainly remember the 'off-brand' kits of yesteryear that didn't have any pros to weigh up against the cons!
