Being a part of a tech start up is an exciting rollercoaster of a journey. While they often come with higher salaries and better perks than more established brands, they also come with their own risks.

That, in short, is how I have found myself at the receiving end of a redundancy process for the second job in a row. 

## My journey

I've always been what I would describe as a tech enthusiast and for that, I blame Star Trek. Hours upon hours of my formative years were spent in front of a TV screen watching the valiant crews of the Enterprise('s'), Voyager and Deep Space Nine solve their problems with technobabble and tapping panels.

Who wouldn't want that as a career right? Unfortunately for me, I wasn't diagnosed with ADHD until I was 29. So trying to sit down and learn how to code, or pay attention as a teenager was a definite mountain. 

Fortunately for me, I was diagnosed and now I have medication which helps me sit down and pay attention to what I'm reading, rather than get distracted by the latest shiny thing. I've also found my way into the tech industry without a computer science degree or strong set of coding skills. With thanks to Monzo for taking a chance on me the better part of a decade ago for their customer support team. 

I've also been lucky in that I've been working for CodeSandbox, who supported me with a web dev essentials course last year and with giving me work projects that helped me to retain and further evolve my coding skills. 

But as said, now I'm redundant. So it's time to think about how to market myself in the current tech world. 

This brings me to:

## This site

With the tech sector contracting in a number of areas in recent years, and lots of redundancies occuring it's not the best time for somebody in their 30s who is very much a junior to get a job. 

But that doesn't mean I can't try to improve my chances, and that's why I built this site. It's a bit of a showcase of everything that I do (and will do). It should also help keep me accountable for projects I start, because I have quite the backlog there already... 

So, please feel free to have a look around. At the time of writing there isn't much here yet. But there will be in the future...
