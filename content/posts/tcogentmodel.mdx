This was a wild story, given the timing. 

A few months earlier a bunch of iconic Star Trek props had resurfaced in the [Greg Jein auction](https://entertainment.ha.com/c/search/results.zx?dept=2182&sold_status=1526&archive_state=5327&mode=archive&auction_name=7278&auction_year=2023&ic4=GalleryView-AuctionNo-051517). Not even a month later, the original (and I mean original, this one was used in the first pilot) Enterprise model resurfaced.

In an eBay listing. The owner seemed to have absolutely no idea what they actually had. It had gone missing in the 70s! There was a happy resolution in this case, the model was returned to the Roddenberry estate, it's rightful owner.
