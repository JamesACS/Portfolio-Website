When Eaglemoss/Hero Collector went bust back in 2022, their remaining stock and upcoming products seemed lost forever. There was hope that some may turn up in bargain stores from the liquidation sale (and to be fair, some did!) but for the most part it was eBay at inflated prices, or out of luck.

Enter [Master Replicas](https://www.masterreplicas.com/) who took on the gargantuan task of locating all the stock, paying off debts and shipping tiny models from around the world to and then from the UK (where they're based). 

The Caretaker's Array in Star Trek merchandise was (is?) somewhat of a cursed item. There have been multiple attempts to get one of shelves from various companies but aside from a limited production run from Micro Machines (which ended up looking more like Atlantis, from Stargate: Atlantis) none have made it. 

Fortunately, Master Replicas' got the produced Hero Collector stock out to fans, so a decent Array is finally out in the world.
