Hi, I'm James 

I'm passionate about building and delivering the Support experiences that you remember, for the right reasons. 

I have over a decade of experience at fast growing tech start ups and I've never been afraid to take on a new challenge. I've migrated entire website tech stacks, built internal audit log tooling and even in the past year a Slack summary application that won two awards for an internal hackathon. 

But I don't just like to 'talk shop'. Though if you want to talk through your current Support struggles please feel free to book in a chat! 

I'm also a full time nerd for all things tech, and passionate Star Trek fan. Which has been known to bleed into the naming and styling of things that I build (like this site).
