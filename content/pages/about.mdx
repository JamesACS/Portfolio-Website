title: About Me

Born in Enfield, London. Now living in Hamilton, Scotland. I've always had a passion for technology. Much to the frustration of my relatives who would sometimes find me disassembling my toys rather than playing with them, then asking for their help when I inevitably couldn't put them back together. 

I've always wanted to get into development, but lacked the resources and support to do so until recently. Now I've built this website in the hopes it will be an ever growing showcase of what I create. Whether it be created in the real world or the digital one. 
## Background

I moved around England a fair amount when I was young due to my Dads job, which had it's ups and downs. Through this time there were three constants. Friends, family and Star Trek. I'm fortunate to have kept a strong network with many of those friends and many of them might argue that they're less fortunate due to how much I talk about Star Trek. 

My role at Monzo saw me leading a team that was mostly based in Glasgow, Scotland. I fell in love with the city, and after 5 years of planning moved nearby a couple of years ago. 
## Projects

I feel that I'm very much a jack of all trades type, which this website will likely show in good time. At the moment I'm working on:

- [Pathfinder Project](https://twitter.com/Pathfinder2374)
No Longer Alone - How Project Pathfinder lit the way home for the U.S.S. Voyager

Inspired by [Wolf 359 Project](https://www.wolf359project.com/), this will be a Federation perspective history of the U.S.S. Voyager. 

I did warn you I liked Star Trek...

I want to keep developing (heh) my skills and this is a good outlet for my coding creativity. Expect to see this evolve as my abilities do! 

- A backlit Master Ships Display 
I built this recently for my office, [read about the research and building process](blog/posts/officemsd)
