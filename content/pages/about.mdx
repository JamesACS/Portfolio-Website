Born in Enfield, London. Now living in Hamilton, Scotland. I've always had a passion for technology. Much to the frustration of my relatives who would sometimes find me disassembling my toys rather than playing with them, then asking for their help when I inevitably couldn't put them back together. 

My career journey didn't start with tech though, it started at John Lewis. A company that gave me a strong foundation of Customer Experience essentials that I then used to break into the tech world (specifically, Fintech). 

I've since built on those foundations, developing a wide operational and technical skillset that I use to drive success and meaningful customer interactions. 

No matter the problem, I like to find a solution. 

## What am I good at? 

- Creating inclusive, collaborative work environments and teams: 

I believe that inclusion and transparency is the clearest (heh) path to success. I wrote the tone of voice guide for Mode and CodeSandbox, leading to measurable improvements in team morale and productivity. 

- Tackling complex problems: 

Whether it be identifying and resolving problems caused by cultural differences between UK and US teams, figuring out why a development project isn't compiling or creating processes to align with cybersecurity certification requirements. I dive straight in. At CodeSandbox I was so determined to implement a better Support contact form that I learned Next.JS and migrated the company website to the app router framework. 

- Advocating for the individual and the team. 

Whether it be People/HR processes or feature requests, in every role I step into I strive for constant improvement. I've mastered the ability to collect and present data to drive meaningful and effective change. 

- Star Trek trivia 

My memory exercise when I was younger was to recite the name of every Star Trek: Voyager episode in order. No, really.
